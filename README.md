## üí® Energy is the future of the world
A web application built by 3 high school students as an activity within international program [Erasmus+](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/) organized by the [European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/), with the aim to educate local and foreigner students about renewable energy sources and their use in Slovakia.

Visitors can find relevant details and learn more about the program and its goals and view a map of Slovakia with its all renewable energy sources, including important metrics like the year of estabilishment and electric power output. More importantly, students and their teachers have the option to generate a report containing the estimated annual CO<sub>2</sub> footprint by their school, depending on the provided parameters. The report also allows them to see the footprint in respective categories like transport, lighing etc.

## üçÉ Being greener
The website also offers tasks, which schools should complete and adapt in order to reduce their carbon footprint. They can, after filling out the relevant data, also see the respective annual footprint reduction brought in by fulfilling it. Formulas and constants for the calculation functions were ported from expert materials and studies.

## üèó How we built it
This is a purely frontend React application coded in JavaScript and served by NextJS.

## ü•á Accomplishments
This project was presented to international students and teachers from Italy, France, Slovenia and Turkey; including people and management at our school. It is registered in a cooperative program hosted by [Deutsche Telekom IT Solutions](https://www.deutschetelekomitsolutions.sk/) and [Technical University of Ko≈°ice](https://www.tuke.sk/) with the aim to build an application that helps people towards eco-friendly actions.
